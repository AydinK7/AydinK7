# 👋 Hi, I’m Aydin!

I’m an Applied Math major and CS minor at UC Santa Cruz, passionate about using code to model and solve complex problems. Right now, I’m diving into AI and robotics through research with the SciAI Pathways program and my work with the Slugbotics club. I love building things that merge math, machine learning, and real-world impact — whether that’s autonomous navigation systems or simulations of multi-agent dynamics.

Always up to talk projects, theory, or cool uses of AI in the wild!

## ✨ Fun Fact

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess, exploring robotics side projects, or reading about AI alignment. (And yes, I will 100% talk your ear off about differential equations.)
