# 👋 Hi, I’m Aydin!

I’m an Applied Math major with a CS minor at UC Santa Cruz, focused on using code and math to model and solve real world problems. Right now I’m working at the intersection of AI and robotics through the SciAI Pathways research program, the Slugbotics robotics club, and my Fall AI Studio project on agentic AI.

I like building systems that merge differential equations, machine learning, and robotics. Whether that’s computer vision for robot arms, hazard detection for autonomous driving, or simulations of multi-agent dynamics, Im always happy to talk projects, theory, or cool uses of AI in the wild.

## ✨ Fun Fact

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess, exploring robotics side projects, or reading about AI alignment. (And yes, I will 100% talk your ear off about differential equations.)
