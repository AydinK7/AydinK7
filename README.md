# 👋 Hi, I’m Aydin!

I’m an Applied Mathematics B.S. student with a Computer Science minor at **UC Santa Cruz**, focused on building **applied machine learning and LLM-based systems** with strong mathematical foundations.

My work centers on:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic LLM systems**
- **Computer vision and multimodal ML pipelines**
- **Scientific computing, numerical methods, and mathematical modeling**

I’m currently involved in **Break Through Tech AI Studio** and **undergraduate research in deep learning**, where I work on applied ML systems with an emphasis on evaluation, robustness, and real-world constraints.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Agentic AI for Technical Document Intelligence (AI Studio 7-11)

**Break Through Tech – AI Studio | ML Engineer Fellow**

Built an **agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for semantic search and question answering over large, unstructured technical documentation.

**Key Contributions**
- Designed and implemented a RAG pipeline using **LangChain, FAISS, and transformer embeddings**
- Built a full ingestion pipeline with **PDF chunking, metadata extraction, and OCR fallback**
- Developed a **multi-agent LLM architecture** (planner, retriever, synthesizer)
- Created standardized evaluation pipelines measuring **Precision@k, Recall@k, and latency**

## 🔬 Research: Deep Learning for Wound Healing

**Undergraduate Researcher | UC Santa Cruz**

Worked on **DeepMapper**, an attention-based autoencoder that learns linear representations of nonlinear wound healing dynamics from image sequences.

- Preprocessed and normalized wound image time series, including noise handling and data augmentation
- Applied temporal attention mechanisms to reduce noise and improve stability
- Learned low-dimensional latent representations aligned with biological healing stages
- Modeled temporal progression using learned linear dynamics
- Evaluated models using reconstruction error, future-state prediction, and stage probability trajectories
- Analyzed performance across mouse and porcine datasets, including cross-species transfer learning

**Slugbotics Cruz Arm Team | UC Santa Cruz**

Worked on **computer vision and vision-language model pipelines** for safety-critical ML systems.

- Implemented real-time object detection and tracking using **OpenCV and YOLOv11**
- Deployed large vision and multimodal models on **Kubernetes-based GPU clusters (Nautilus)**
- Conducted performance testing focused on **accuracy, latency, and robustness**
- Integrated ML inference pipelines with downstream decision-making systems
